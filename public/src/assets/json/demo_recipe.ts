		title: 'Vietnamese-Style Pork Meatballs',
		summary: 'These nuoc cham-inspired meatballs are perfect to fill lettuce cups topped with fresh basil or cilantro. (Add steamed rice for a more substantial meal.) The Ritz crackers here make for a juicier meatball, but feel free to substitute plain dry bread crumbs. To make the Ritz crumbs, place the crackers in a resealable plastic bag and lightly crush them with the back of a wooden spoon or measuring cup. For an easy dipping sauce, spike 1/4 cup mayonnaise with 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil or soy sauce. And save any leftover meatballs: They\'re great simmered in chicken broth the next day. The ginger and garlic in them release their aromatics into the broth for a deeply flavorful soup base.',

		title: '3 Cheese Cauliflower Casserole ',
		summary: 'There\'s no shortage of richness in this casserole. Here, three types of cheese and heavy cream result in something luxurious and comforting, perfect for colder weather. Make sure to drain and dry the blanched cauliflower well, since excess water could break the creamy sauce and make it separate. Serve as a side with any braised or roasted meat or, for a more virtuous vegetarian dinner, balance it with a salad tossed with a bright, lemony vinaigrette.',

		summary: 'For a weeknight salmon that’s impressive enough for entertaining, look no further. Salty miso paste and sweet maple syrup are the backbone of this simple, flavor-packed marinade, which is about as involved as this uncomplicated recipe gets. Here, the fish soaks up the sauce as the oven gets hot, and the snappy green beans roast in the same amount of time as the fillets. Start some rice when you walk in the door and you’ll have dinner on the table in under a half hour.',

		title: 'Everything Parker House Rolls',
		summary: 'There’s nothing better than a warm Parker House roll, except maybe one with a salty, seedy everything-bagel topping. While there are a million subtle variations of the classic roll, this recipe keeps the shape simple (just basic rounds) for the most buttery, fluffiest results. You can purchase everything-bagel seasoning in the spice section of some supermarkets, but it’s also easy to make your own.',

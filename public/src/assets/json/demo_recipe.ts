		summary: 'If you don’t grow your own herbs, I suggest that you buy a bunch of parsley along with basil or chives to keep on hand in your refrigerator. The herbs will keep for a week if properly stored. Produce departments often use misters, a practice that drives me crazy because leafy greens don’t keep well once wet. So when you get home, spin the herbs in salad spinner if they’re wet, wrap them in a paper towel and then bag them.',

Soft and luxurious, bathed in an emulsified mixture of sesame paste and peanut butter, rendered vivid and fiery by chili oil and sweetened by sugar, then cut by vinegar, this version brings home what used to be classic New York takeout. “The art is in the balance,” Mr. Schoenfeld said at the time, “between the salt and sweet, the sweet and the fire, and the fire and the acidity.”',
